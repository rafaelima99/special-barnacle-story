	Ten men were on a bus from Madison to Chicago at 2 in the morning. Because it was late in the night, all people on the bus, except Tom,  were sleepy. Tom always stayed up late for his Computer Science course at college. He is used to the living habit. He stared at outside the window purposelessly. Suddenly, he saw a dragon jumping out of a lake along the road.
