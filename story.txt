	Ten men were on a bus from Madison to Chicago at 2 in the morning. Because it was late in the night, all people on the bus, except Tom,  were sleepy. Tom always stayed up late for his Computer Science course at college. He is used to the living habit. He stared at outside the window purposelessly. Suddenly, he saw a dragon jumping out of a lake along the road.
	Tom could not believe his eyes! He asked around if any of the other men on the bus saw the same thing. But everybody looked at him as though he was out of his mind. Tom decided that it was just a hallucination from him being so tired. But instead of going to sleep, he decided to go on his laptop and do some CS homework. After a few minutes of painful coding, Tom decided to take a break and look out the window again.
	Outside the window, Tom saw the night sky and a full moon that shined bright. Tom watched the moon and thought about how something so  big could appear so small to him. He imagined himself floating next to moon in space. There, he was free from his bus ride and far from his CS homework. As Tom gazed at the moon and calmly thought about this, he saw something fly across the moon.
