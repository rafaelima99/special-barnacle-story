	Terry was walking down the street one day when he found a piece of paper on the sidewalk. He bent down and grabbed it with the intent of putting it in the recycling bin. As he grabbed it the piece of paper screamed and shouted "Hey! I'm trying to nap here!". Terry was taken aback by such an interaction. Confused, yet curious, he said "Sorry, I didn't realize you were alive. I've never met a piece of paper that can talk before.". The paper, annoyed and groggy, responded sarcastically "Yeah and I've never met a nosy human too!".
